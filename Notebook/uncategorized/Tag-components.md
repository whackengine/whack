- The tags “p”, “a”, “b”, “u”, “i”, “s”, “ul”, “ol”, “li”, “h[1-5]”, “table”, “thead”, “tbody”, “tfoot”, “tr”, “th”, “td”, “pre”, “code”, “img”, “blockquote”, “br” and “hr” convert to equivalent ActionScript components, such as whack.components.hypertext.B and whack.components.hypertext.A, and may be used as type selectors in CSS as well (like the rule a {} instead of rule wt|A {}). The reason that these use component types is that they allow defining CSS properties.
- Tag components should be able to get and set text and get and set inner HTML (which uses Whack's HTML-to-UIComponents processing)
